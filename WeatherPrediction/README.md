## Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) to predict the severity and cost of U.S. storms using NOAA historical data. Feature engineering, extensive EDA, and model tuning were performed to maximize predictive performance and provide actionable insights for disaster management.

## Highlights

- Data cleaning and merging of multi-table NOAA dataset
- Feature engineering (seasonality, event type, normalized duration)
- 24% reduction in MAE for cost prediction (XGBoost)
- Classification accuracy up to 88% (Random Forest)
- Visualizations and analysis for feature importances and model performance
