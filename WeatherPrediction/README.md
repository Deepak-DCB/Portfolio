## Overview

Machine learning project predicting severity and cost of U.S. storms using NOAA data, with extensive feature engineering and model validation.

---

## Contents

- `StormPrediction.ipynb` – Complete data pipeline and modeling notebook
- `Data_Mining_FinalReport.pdf` – Formal report *(update filename if different)*

---

## Highlights

- Data cleaning, multi-table merging, feature engineering (season, normalized duration)
- Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
- Achieved 24% reduction in cost prediction error (XGBoost), classification accuracy up to 88%
- Visualizations and analysis for feature importance and performance

---

## Getting Started

Open `StormPrediction.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab.  
Raw data: [NOAA Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/).
