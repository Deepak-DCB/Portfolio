# Hybrid Nanofluid Density Analysis

**Author:** Deepak Binkam  
**Course:** Data Mining (COSC 757), Towson University

## Overview

This folder contains two complementary projects focused on hybrid nanofluid density:
- **Regression Analysis** – Predicts nanofluid density using regression models.
- **Clustering Analysis** – Reveals natural groupings and patterns in nanofluid data.

Both projects use the same experimental dataset of 436 hybrid nanofluid samples.

## Project Summaries

### **Density Prediction Using Regression**
- Data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering (polynomial features, robust scaling)
- Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest modeling (R² > 0.99)
- Analysis of linear vs. non-linear models

### **Density Analysis Using Clustering**
- K-Means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN clustering
- Feature engineering, PCA-based visualization, cluster interpretation

## Getting Started

Open either notebook (`NanoparticleDensityPredRegression.ipynb` or `NanoparticleDensityPredClustering.ipynb`) in Jupyter, Colab, or VS Code.  
Data file: If required, download the [Kaggle nanofluid dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/...) and place it in this folder.
