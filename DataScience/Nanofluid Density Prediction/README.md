# Hybrid Nanofluid Density Analysis

**Author:** Deepak Binkam  
**Course:** Data Mining (COSC 757), Towson University


This folder contains two complementary projects focused on hybrid nanofluid density:
- **Regression Analysis** – Predicts nanofluid density using regression models.
- **Clustering Analysis** – Reveals natural groupings and patterns in nanofluid data.

Both projects use the same experimental dataset of 436 hybrid nanofluid samples.

## Getting Started

Open either notebook (`NanoparticleDensityPredRegression.ipynb` or `NanoparticleDensityPredClustering.ipynb`) in Jupyter, Colab, or VS Code.  
Data file: If required, download the [Kaggle nanofluid dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ai4a-lab/nanofluid-density-prediction) and place it in this folder.
