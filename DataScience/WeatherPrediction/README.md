## Highlights

- Data cleaning, multi-table merging, feature engineering (season, normalized duration)
- Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
- Achieved 24% reduction in cost prediction error (XGBoost), classification accuracy up to 88%
- Visualizations and analysis for feature importance and performance
